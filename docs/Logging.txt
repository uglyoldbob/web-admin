Logging

Normal logging is placed into /log/stdout.log
	This is meant to hold informational entries/
	To add an entry to this log file from the server, use System.out.println
Error and other logging will be placed into /log/error.log.
	This is to indicate problems that happened that require more attention than the normal log
	To add an entry to this log file, use one of the following methods (from most severe to least severe):
		_log.fatal(String msg);
		_log.error(String msg);
		_log.warn(Object msg);
		_log.info(String msg);
		_log.debug(String msg);
		_log.trace(String msg);

	When you add a message to either of the log files, please add that to this file.
